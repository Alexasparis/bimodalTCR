# utils.py: This file contains utility functions that are shared by the different scripts in the project.

# Finctions:
# 1) residue_mapping: Dictionary mapping three-letter residue names to one-letter codes.
# 2) extract_sequences (pdb_file): Extract sequences for all chains from a PDB file.
# 3) extract_specific_sequences (pdb_file, chain_types_dict): Extracts specific sequences (TCRA, TCRB, and peptide) from a PDB file based on chain types.
# 4) parse_general_file (general_file): Parses the general file and creates a dictionary mapping PDB IDs to specific chain information such as 'tcra_chain', 'tcrb_chain', 'peptide_chain', and 'mhc_chain'.
# 5) calculate_sequence_distance (seq1, seq2): calculates lenshtein ditance between sequences.
